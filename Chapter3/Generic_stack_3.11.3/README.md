Write a stack implementation for a generic value type. The maximal size of the stack is
defined in the class (hard-wired). Provide the following functions:
• Constructor;
• Destructor if necessary;
• top: show last element;
• pop: remove last element (without returning);
• push: insert new element;
• clear: delete all entries;
• size: number of elements;
• full: whether stack is full;
• empty: whether stack is empty.
Stack over- or underflow must throw an exception.


Note: The solution is implemented using linked lists.
